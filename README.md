# Brain Tumor Classification
This project was done by [@MingFengC](https://github.com/MingFengC), [@renachongpq](https://github.com/renachongpq) and [@mslevis](https://github.com/mslevis).

## Objective
The project aims to classify brain tumors into benign or malignant type given the brain MRI image. Malignant tumors are cancerous and grow rapidly, while benign tumors generally do not spread to other parts of the body and are less harmful than malignant ones. Though benign tumors are non cancerous, they can still put pressure on other body parts. Therefore, early and accurate detection of tumors is important so that proper medical treatment can be provided, especially for malignent tumors.
